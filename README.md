In the file ff17_magd150_lab03_Addie, I created a variable of circles and movement. The goal of this project was to explore the use of integers and mathmatics to create movement. 

In the file f17_magd150_lab04_Addie 2, ellipses move around the screen, pulse upon mouse pressed and follow the mouse movement. The goal of this project was to learn how to use if else statements. 

In the s17_magd150_lab06_Addie 5, I practice how to use classes to create a screensaver. In this code two ellipses follow a path and  create a pattern as they go. 

In the folder s17_magd150_lab07_Addie 2/s17_magd150_lab07_Addie, I practice using strings to create mant triangles to form the petals of a flower being blown in the wind. 


In f17_magd150_lab09_Addie 2, this was my personal favorite project. For this I learned how to import a video file, or live camera feed. I used my photo from Akihabara,Japan to use as a background, and allowed users to feel like they were on a television there.
